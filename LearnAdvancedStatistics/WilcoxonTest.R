# WILCOXON RANK SUM TEST (small samples)

" H0: distributions for populations 1 and 2 are identical
  Ha: distributions for pop1 and 2 are different (two tailed)
      or distribution for pop1 lies to left of pop2's (left tailed)
      or distribution for pop1 lies to right of pop2's (right tailed)"

"PROCEDURE: 
1. Rank all n 1 Ï© n 2 observations from small to large.

2. Left tailed test statistic: TL = rank sum of observations in n1.

3. Right tailed test statistic: TR = n1(n1 + n2 + 1) - TL
This is the rank sum of group n1 if the ranks had been reversed from big to small. 

4. Two tailed test statistic: T = min of TR and TL.

5. H0 is rejected if the observed test statistic is beyond the critical
value found using Table 7 in Appendix I.

one a standard kraft paper of a specified weight and the other the same standard kraft
